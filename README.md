# Indian Potholes — Community Fork (Static)

A front‑end‑only fork inspired by indianpotholes.com. This is meant for demos, hackathons, and local testing.

### What's inside
- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Report uploads stored in `localStorage`
- Leaflet map to pick latitude/longitude
- Gallery of reported potholes (images stored as base64 in localStorage)
- Leaderboard by reporter email
- Minimal login/register (localStorage demo — not secure)

### Quick start
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Go to **Report** to add a pothole (pick a spot on the map).
3. See it in **Gallery** and your rank in **Leaderboard**.

> To make this production-ready, replace localStorage with a backend (REST/GraphQL), add auth, moderation, and municipal workflows.
